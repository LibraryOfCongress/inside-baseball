# Inside Baseball: Baseball Collections as Data Event Background #

LC Labs, Jstor Labs, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture collaborated on Inside Baseball Week (7/9/2018-7/13/2018), an exercise in user-centered design rapid-prototyping to create applications to access baseball digital collections across our cultural heritage organizations.   

LC Labs built the application “Mapping an American Pastime” which uses a timeline, mapping, and open search to browse baseball-related digital collections from the Library of Congress and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Jstor Labs facilitated the LC Labs team in their first data-jam and flash build effort.   

The LC Labs team and the Jstor Labs team publicly presented their applications at the Inside Baseball Labs Showcase on Friday, July 13th, 2018. The archived livestream of the event is here.   

We’d like to thank first and foremost our data divinator, visiting Archivist Julia Hickey, our Library of Congress team members Griff Friedman, UX Designer, Chris Adams, LC Information Technology Specialist, Meghan Ferriter, Abbey Potter, and Jaime Mears of LC Labs, and our amazing support crew: Junior Fellows Eileen Jakeaway and Courtney Johnson, HACU Intern Yassira Sueiras, and UVA Fellow Erin Dlott.   
We’d also like to thank our fearless leader, Jstor Labs facilitator Beth Dufford.
