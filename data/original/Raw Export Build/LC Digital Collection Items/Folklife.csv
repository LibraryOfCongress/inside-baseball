Bell, Thomas  A. Burns, Carl Fleischhauer, Henry Horenstein, Geraldine Niva Johnson, and  Kenneth S. Goldstein, project director. Sound recordings include interviews and  documentation of a play, church services, music and dance, and other events.  Photographs include subjects such as Rhode Island houses, barns, beaches,  yards, gardens, orchards, churches, cemeteries, street scenes, landscapes,  seascapes, and religious processions. Many photos highlight occupational  culture, including photos of textile mills, sawmills, markets, restaurants,  Jamaican migrant workers, woodworking, boatbuilding, fishing, clamming,  gunsmithing, and taxidermy. Others feature recreational subjects, including  baseball, horseshoes, sailing, picnics, arts and crafts, sand sculptures,  music, and dance.</p>  <p>This online presentation  includes the majority of the sound recordings and photographs in this  collection. Selected manuscripts include those materials created by the  fieldworkers, such as audio and photo logs, field notes, and final reports. The  remainder of the collection is available in the Folklife Reading Room at the  Library of Congress. A <a href=""http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.afc/eadafc.af016004"">finding aid</a> to the entire  collection is also available online.</p>  <p>The mission of the Library of Congress is  to make its resources available and useful to the Congress and the American  people. Through its website, the Library offers broad public access to a wide  range of information, including historical materials that may contain offensive  language or negative stereotypes. Such materials must be viewed in the context  of the relevant time period. The Library of Congress does not endorse the views  expressed in such materials. The events documented here are the personal recollections  and perspectives of participating individuals; they are recordings of people’s  own stories and not necessarily the truth.</p>","2018-06-21T06:55:32.167Z","2018-06-21T06:34:41.082Z","1979","http://www.loc.gov/collections/rhode-island-folklife-project/about-this-collection/","979","1979-01-01T00:00:00Z","","english","https://www.loc.gov/collections/rhode-island-folklife-project/about-this-collection/","https://www.loc.gov/collections/rhode-island-folklife-project/","False","https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/rhode-island-folklife-project/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155","https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/rhode-island-folklife-project/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500","","","","http://www.loc.gov/collections/rhode-island-folklife-project/about-this-collection/","https://lccn.loc.gov/2010655341","https://www.loc.gov/item/2010655341","https://www.loc.gov/collections/rhode-island-folklife-project/about-this-collection/","http://lccn.loc.gov/2010655341","http://www.loc.gov/item/2010655341/"
