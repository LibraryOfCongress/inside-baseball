When he stepped onto Ebbets field on April 15th, 1947, Robinson became the first African American in the twentieth century to play baseball in the major leagues -- breaking the ""color line,"" a segregation practice dating to the nineteenth century. Jackie Robinson was an extremely talented multi-sport athlete and a courageous man who played an active role in civil rights. This presentation was created to commemorate his achievements and describe some aspects of the color line's development and the Negro Leagues. Materials that tell his story, and the history of baseball in general, are located throughout the Library of Congress. This web presentation was made possible by a generous gift from the Citigroup Foundation.</p> <h2>Selection Criteria</h2> <p>While the Library of Congress does not have collections that focus solely on Jackie Robinson, the baseball color line, or the Negro Leagues, diverse original materials relevant to all of these topics can be found through the Library's numerous reading rooms. With the goal of representing many different media, Library staff selected and reproduced approximately 30 interesting items created between the 1860s and the 1960s, including manuscripts, photographs, ephemera, and books. Narrative information drawn from encyclopedia articles, published biographies, and baseball histories established the context for understanding the original materials.</p> <p>The Library holds additional original materials that could not be reproduced here, either because they are still under copyright protection (for example, NBC radio broadcasts), or, because digitization would be very expensive (for example, the full-length movie The Jackie Robinson Story).</p> <p>This online presentation introduces a multi-faceted man and a variety of complex issues, topics, and events that risk oversimplification in any short retelling. Books listed in the <a href=""/collections/jackie-robinson-baseball/about-this-collection/related-resources/#bibliography"">Bibliography</a> should be consulted for further information.</p> <p>The breadth of resources at the Library of Congress is impressive, but other libraries and organizations also offer a wealth of information on these subjects. Selected sources are listed in the <a href=""/collections/jackie-robinson-baseball/about-this-collection/related-resources/#related-websites"">Related Web Sites </a>section.</p> <h2>By Popular Demand: Images from the Prints and Photographs Division</h2> <p>Library patrons and staff often select pictorial materials from the Prints and Photographs Division for reproduction in books, exhibits, lectures, television documentaries, decorative calendars, research papers, and many other kinds of projects. Researchers arrange with the Library's Photoduplication Service to produce copies of selected items. Typically ordered are 8x10-inch prints or 4x5-inch color transparencies. In order to make the prints, the Photoduplication Service must create a copy negative, if none exists. Afterwards, those negatives and color transparencies are added to a file of high-demand images maintained by the Prints and Photographs Division.</p> <p>In 1996, this file contained approximately 120,000 negatives and transparencies. The high demand image file serves as a ready reference source for many of the Library's most popular pictures. The high-demand image file complements the division's heavily used collections of original negatives, including its Selected Civil War Photographs , Farm Security Administration/Office of War Information Collection (forthcoming), and Historic American Buildings Survey and Historic American Engineering Record collections.</p> <p>Over time, the Library plans to place a significant percentage of the high-demand file online under the series title ""By Popular Demand."" The first group of images will consist of items which appear in staff-selected illustrated reference aids. Likely candidates will be guides relating to immigration at Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. The entire high-demand file covers a broad range of international subjects and popular American topics such as eyewitness drawings of the Civil War, photographs of Native Americans, historical prints by Currier & Ives, political cartoons, and portraits of prominent figures in many fields.</p>","2018-06-21T06:55:30.640Z","","","","2018-06-21T06:34:41.082Z","1998","GV865.R6","71","http://www.loc.gov/collections/jackie-robinson-baseball/about-this-collection/","http://www.loc.gov/collections/jackie/","http://lccn.loc.gov/00530049","http://www.loc.gov/item/00530049/","http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.robinson","http://www.loc.gov/resource/pp.robinson/","","","","","","","","","","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","english","https://www.loc.gov/collections/jackie-robinson-baseball/about-this-collection/","https://www.loc.gov/collections/jackie-robinson-baseball/","False","https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/jackie-robinson-baseball/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155","https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/jackie-robinson-baseball/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From American Treasures exhibition: ""Baseball, America's national pastime, evolved from a child's game to an organized sport in the 1840s and 1850s. It was an urban sport, and the first teams were established in New York City and Brooklyn. By 1860 baseball had replaced cricket as the nation's most popular ball game. Before the Civil War, more than one hundred baseball teams played in the New York City area. During the war, the number of teams dwindled to fewer than thirty, but thousands of spectators flocked to games.    The Brooklyn Atlantics dominated early baseball by winning championships in 1861, 1864, and 1865. The Atlantics usually crushed their competition, scoring two or three times more runs than their opponents. The game was an amateur sport: according to the rules of the National Association of Base Ball Players, athletes could not accept wages to play ball, although gifts and jobs were sometimes offered as a means of compensation.    Baseball cards as we know them did not become commonplace until the 1880s. This early prototype is actually an original photograph mounted on a card. At the start of the 1865 season, the Atlantics presented opposing teams with framed photographs of the ""Champion Nine."" The Scottish-born photographer Charles H. Williamson opened a daguerreotype studio in Brooklyn in 1851, continuing to work as a photographer until his death in 1874.""","2017-10-21T17:35:44.876Z","pictures","ammem","catalog","2017-10-21T17:35:13.937Z","1865","PH - Williamson (C.), no. 1 (AA size) (LOCKED) [P&P]","","http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/ph/item/92514548/","http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3g04572","http://www.loc.gov/item/92514548/","http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/92514548/","http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ppmsca.09310","http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/cph.3b40721","http://www.loc.gov/resource/ppmsca.09310/","http://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3g04572/","http://www.loc.gov/resource/cph.3b40721/","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/AMALL:@field(NUMBER+@band(ppmsca+09310))","http://lccn.loc.gov/92514548","","","","","1865-01-01T00:00:00Z","english","https://www.loc.gov/item/92514548/","","False","//cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/ppmsca/09300/09310_150px.jpg","//cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/ppmsca/09300/09310_150px.jpg#h=114&w=150","//cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/ppmsca/09300/09310t.gif#h=114&w=150","//cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/ppmsca/09300/09310r.jpg#h=485&w=640","//cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/ppmsca/09300/09310v.jpg#h=776&w=1024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not to be reproduced for trade or advertising purposes.)This photograph is one of many taken to illustrate the article ""My Future,"" published in Look magazine on January 22, 1957.    Jackie Robinson decided to retire from baseball after the 1956  season. He accepted a job offer from the Chock Full O' Nuts restaurant  chain in New York and contracted with Look magazine to write an article  to break the news and explain his reason ""my legs are gone and I know  it"" (from Glenn Stout's Jackie Robinson,  p. 178) (Robinson had worked with Look before, most recently to publish  an autobiographical series in January and February 1955.) In December  1956, a month before the ""My Future"" article appeared, the Dodgers'  general manager told Robinson that the team had traded him to the New  York Giants. Robinson followed through with his retirement plans,  although the Giants' management tried to change his mind. On April 14,  1957, in an interview on the  Meet the Press television program, Robinson discussed the pros  and cons of trading baseball players, the impact of baseball's reserve  clause, and civil rights in general, and his role in the NAACP Freedom  Fund Campaign.
