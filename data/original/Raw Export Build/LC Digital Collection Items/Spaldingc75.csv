The collection reproduces 35 of the guides, which were published by the  Spalding Athletic Company in the late nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries. <em>Spalding’s Official Base Ball Guide</em> was perhaps the  premier publication of its day for the game of baseball. It featured  editorials from baseball writers on the state of the game, statistics,  photographs, and analysis of the previous season for all the Major  League teams and for many of the so-called minor leagues across the  nation. The 15 <em>Spalding’s Official Base Ball Guides</em> included in this online collection were published between 1889 and 1939. The <em>Official Indoor Baseball Guide</em> concerns a game unfamiliar to most contemporary baseball fans because  its demise occurred almost beyond living memory. These guides, too,  offer rules and “how-to’s” of the game, information on the game’s  founding fathers, photographic illustrations of teams and players from  across the land, and game statistics. The 20 <em>Official Indoor Base Ball Guides</em> included in this collection were published between 1903 and 1926.</p> <p>During his more than twenty-one years' involvement with baseball’s  Major Leagues, A.G. (Albert Goodwill) Spalding (1850-1915) was a  baseball player, manager, and executive. With his brother he began the  sporting-goods manufacturing and retail business that still bears his  name and is known to millions. He also founded a publishing house, the  American Sports Publishing Company.</p> <p>Between the late nineteenth and the mid-twentieth centuries, the  American Sports Publishing Company issued works that can be classified  in three general categories. The first is instructional manuals, such as <em>How to Play Second Base, How to Bowl, and How to Play American Hand Ball</em>.  The second is rule books for many sports. The third category, and the  one most widely used by researchers and sports historians, is the  annuals that both narratively and statistically summarized the previous  year's history, accomplishments, and records for a specific sport. A few  of the sports covered are baseball, women's basketball, golf, college  football, and track and field athletics. Collectively, these are known  as Spalding Guides. In addition to the text, all guides included an  advertising section for the Spalding sporting-goods empire that provides  a fascinating history of the development of everything from baseball  gloves, tennis racquets, and ice skates to golf clubs and football  cleats; the Spalding Company made them all.</p> <p>The Library of Congress has more than one thousand of these guides,  believed to be the largest collection held by any institution. A small  sample is offered here in <em>Spalding Base Ball Guides, 1889-1939</em>; in the future, the entire collection may be digitized and made available on this Web site. The twenty <em>Official Indoor Base Ball Guides</em> and fifteen <em>Spalding's Official Base Ball Guides</em> currently presented are examples of the annuals described above.</p> <p>While the game of baseball covered in <em>Spalding’s Official Base Ball Guides</em> is well known to most Americans, the game described in the <em>Official Indoor Base Ball Guides</em> may at first seem unfamiliar--yet in its current incarnation it is  probably played by more Americans than traditional baseball. According  to <em>The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary</em>, indoor baseball is  “[t]he original name for the game from which modern softball derived.  Its rules were written by George W. Hancock of Chicago who was one of  the group of young men who created the game, using a boxing glove for a  ball and a broomstick for a bat, while waiting at the Farragut Boat Club  for the telegraphed results of the Harvard-Yale football game on  Thanksgiving Day, 1887. Thus, softball in its first incarnation was  baseball played inside a gymnasium” (Paul Dickson, <em>The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary</em> [New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1990], p. 268).</p> <p>Brief biographies of A.G. Spalding can be found in <em>The Ballplayers</em>, edited by Mike Shatzkin (New York: Arbor House/William Morrow, 1990; Library of Congress call number GV865.A1 B323 1990) and <em>Biographical Dictionary of American Sports. Baseball</em>,  edited by David L. Porter (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2000;  Library of Congress call number GV865.A1 B55 2000). The definitive  biography is <em>A.G. Spalding and the Rise of Baseball: The Promise of American Sport</em>, by Peter Levine (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985; Library of Congress call number GV865.S7 L48 1985).</p>","2018-06-21T06:55:32.167Z","2018-06-21T06:36:12.220Z","","http://www.loc.gov/collections/spalding-base-ball-guides/about-this-collection/","","","39","https://www.loc.gov/collections/spalding-base-ball-guides/about-this-collection/","https://www.loc.gov/collections/spalding-base-ball-guides/","False","https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/spalding-base-ball-guides/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155","https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/spalding-base-ball-guides/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500","","http://www.loc.gov/collections/spalding-base-ball-guides/about-this-collection/","http://www.loc.gov/collections/spalding/","",""

The scanning took  place off-site at Acme Bookbinding, Inc. During conservation work to  prepare the Indoor guides for scanning, metal staples were  removed from the bindings, allowing the guides to be disbound before  scanning. The contract with Acme Bookbinding called for the work to be  carried out with a flatbed scanner; an overhead scanner would have been  required to scan additional copies of Spalding’s Official Base Ball Guide, which had glue bindings.","2018-06-21T06:56:03.605Z","2018-06-21T06:45:42.945Z","","http://www.loc.gov/collections/spalding-base-ball-guides/about-this-collection/digitizing-the-collection/","","english","","https://www.loc.gov/collections/spalding-base-ball-guides/about-this-collection/digitizing-the-collection/","","False","","","","http://www.loc.gov/collections/spalding-base-ball-guides/about-this-collection/digitizing-the-collection/","","",""
