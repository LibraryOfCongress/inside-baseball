For example, from 1895 to 1920, a time marked by the American heyday of the parlor piano and the prominence of the popular music publishing industry called ""Tin Pan Alley,"" it was common for family and friends to gather around the piano for an evening's entertainment. This national pastime began to decline in the 1920's with the rise of the broadcasting and recording industries. Coincident with this unique musical era, baseball, THE national pastime, experienced what some writers call its ""Silver Age:"" a time when dual major league status was re-established, when the World Series was instituted, and when Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth became the heroes that composers rhapsodized about.  Indeed, it was the songwriters who first designated baseball as ""America's National Game.""</p>","2018-06-21T06:55:28.843Z","2018-06-21T06:34:41.082Z","","http://www.loc.gov/collections/baseball-sheet-music/about-this-collection/","238","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://www.loc.gov/collections/baseball-sheet-music/about-this-collection/","https://www.loc.gov/collections/baseball-sheet-music/","False","https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/baseball-sheet-music/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155","https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/baseball-sheet-music/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500","","","http://www.loc.gov/collections/baseball-sheet-music/about-this-collection/","http://www.loc.gov/collections/bbsm/","","","","","","",""
