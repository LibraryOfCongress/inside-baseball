Before The Civil War, More Than One Hundred Baseball Teams Played In The New York City Area. During The War, The Number Of Teams Dwindled To Fewer Than Thirty, But Thousands Of Spectators Flocked To Games.    The Brooklyn Atlantics Dominated Early Baseball By Winning Championships In 1861, 1864, And 1865. The Atlantics Usually Crushed Their Competition, Scoring Two Or Three Times More Runs Than Their Opponents. The Game Was An Amateur Sport: According To The Rules Of The National Association Of Base Ball Players, Athletes Could Not Accept Wages To Play Ball, Although Gifts And Jobs Were Sometimes Offered As A Means Of Compensation.    Baseball Cards As We Know Them Did Not Become Commonplace Until The 1880S. This Early Prototype Is Actually An Original Photograph Mounted On A Card.

Willie Mays Baseball Game consisting of a box (.1abc), game board (.2), photo (.3), game rules (.4), and three (3) score cards (.5.1-3). .1abc: This cardboard box lid (a), box bottom (b), and inner cardboard support (c) are for the board game Say Hey! Willie Mays' Baseball Game. The lid of the box (a) has a polka-dot pattern with small white squares on a green background. On the left side of the lid is a square outlined with a white border with a solid green background. The square is slightly at a diagonal and contains text of varying font in black and white reading ""Say / Hey! / IT'S WILLIE MAYS' OWN / BASEBALL / GAME"". Within the square
in the upper left corner is a white and blue tinted portrait of Willie Mays. Mays is seen looking to the right and wears a New York Giants baseball hat. Below Mays' chin is his autograph pre-printed in blue ink. In the lower left corner of the square are three (3) small lines of text reading ""AN OLIVER GAME / ©1954 TOY / DEVELOPMENT CO. INC."". On the right side of the top of the lid are three (3) blocks of white with blue text with varying fonts reading ""1954's / Most / Valuable / Player / SAYS: / YOU CAN
PLAY THIS GAME FOR / HOURS. / IT TEACHES YOU THE RULES AND / STRATEGY OF BASEBAL AND /
SHARPENS YOUR HAND AND EYE / COORDINATION. / IT'S FUN!"". On the outside edges of the four (4) sides of the lid is a white rectangle with blue text reading ""WILLIE MAYS' BASEBALL GAME"". The bottom of the box (b) is cardboard and lined on the outside in white. The inner support (c) is plain cardboard with bent edges so that the game board and supplements rest above the bottom, leaving room for playing pieces below.

.2: The game board is made from cardboard and creased in the middle so that it can fold and fit within the box. On the top of the board, in the upper right quadrant extending out to the middle is a green background with a yellow, rounded square that depicts the infield of a baseball diamond. Depicted as white squares, are first, second, and third bases, on the yellow infield. In the upper right corner is a white circle situated above home base. The white circle is divided into wedge sections in green with a metal spinner attached in the center. The spinner has an arrow at one end and a circle at the other. Situated over the pitcher is another circle with white outlines. The circle is also divided into different wedge sections. Within this circle is a metal spinner in the center. The pitcher's mound is located right of center above the crease across the center of the board. In the lower left corner is a white circle situated over centerfield. This circle is divided into wedge sections in green ink with a metal spinner at center of the circle. At the top and along the right side is a narrow white line. Along the left side and bottom side are white, illustrated heads, representing spectators at a baseball game. At the bottom in the lower right quadrant are signs held by the spectators. The signs are situated upside-down and spell out Mays' first name [WILLIE]. On the right side just above the middle are signs held by the spectators that spell Mays' last name [MAYS]. All the signs are white with yellow letters. The board is covered with green textured material on the back.

.3: An insert for the game of a sepia-toned portrait of Willie Mays wearing a New York Giants baseball uniform. He looks to the left and is seen smiling and is pictured from the waist up with his arms resting on his upper thighs. He wears a dark baseball hat and white jersey with dark letters. Over top of the PL sleeve of Mays' jersey is his pre-printed autograph. Mays is seen in front of a textured background. The reverse of the insert is blank.

.4: An insert for the game with the playing rules printed in blue ink. The reverse of the insert is blank.

.5.1-3: Three (3) score cards for the game, all alike. Each card consists of a table divided into different columns relating to the various aspects of play while participating in the board game. The center columns are divided further into four (4) smaller units with diamonds in the center. At the top of the card is text in blue reading ""WILLIE MAYS SCORE CARD BASEBALL GAME"". The reverse of .1 and .3 are blank, while there is a handwritten grid in pencil on the reverse of .2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No Known Copyright Restrictions

For The First Time, Digital Scans Of Both Adams'S Original Negatives And His Photographic Prints Appear Side By Side Allowing Viewers To See Adams'S Darkroom Technique, In Particular, How He Cropped His Prints.  Adams'S Manzanar Work Is A Departure From His Signature Style Landscape Photography. Although A Majority Of The More Than 200 Photographs Are Portraits, The Images Also Include Views Of Daily Life, Agricultural Scenes, And Sports And Leisure Activities (See Collection Highlights). When Offering The Collection To The Library In 1965, Adams Said In A Letter, ""The Purpose Of My Work Was To Show How These People, Suffering Under A Great Injustice, And Loss Of Property, Businesses And Professions, Had Overcome The Sense Of Defeat And Dispair [Sic] By Building For Themselves A Vital Community In An Arid (But Magnificent) Environment....All In All, I Think This Manzanar Collection Is An Important Historical Document, And I Trust It Can Be Put To Good Use.""

Best Remembered For His Views Of Yosemite And The Sierra Nevada, His Photographs Emphasize The Natural Beauty Of The Land. By Contrast, Adams'S Photographs Of People Have Been Largely Overlooked. Trained As A Musician, In 1927 Adams Made A Photograph—Monolith, The Face Of Half-Dome—That Changed His Career. This Dramatic Photograph, Along With Seventeen Others, Was Published That Same Year In Adams'S First Portfolio, Parmelian Prints Of The High Sierras. By 1940 Adams Was An Established Fine Art Photographer. His Work Had Been Exhibited In One-Person Shows At Major Museums On Both The East And West Coasts, He Served On The Board Of The Photography Department At The Museum Of Modern Art (New York City), And He Was Offered Lucrative Commercial Assignments.</P> <H3>War Relocation Program </H3> <P>After Japan Bombed Pearl Harbor On December 7, 1941, Fear Of A Japanese Invasion And Subversive Acts By Japanese-Americans Prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt To Sign Executive Order 9066 On February 19, 1942. The Act Designated The West Coast As A Military Zone From Which ""Any Or All Persons May Be Excluded."" Although Not Specified In The Order, Japanese-Americans Were Singled Out For Evacuation. More Than 110,000 People Of Japanese Ancestry Were Removed From Their Homes In California, Southern Arizona, And Western Washington And Oregon And Sent To Ten Relocation Camps. Those Forcibly Removed From Their Homes, Businesses, And Possessions Included Japanese Immigrants Legally Forbidden From Becoming Citizens (Issei), The American-Born (Nisei), And Children Of The American-Born (Sansei).</P> <H3>Adams'S Work At Manzanar </H3> <P>This Event Struck A Personal Chord With Adams When Harry Oye, His Parents' Longtime Employee Who Was An Issei In Poor Health, Was Summarily Picked Up By Authorities And Sent To A Hospital Halfway Across The Country In Missouri. Angered By This Event, Adams Welcomed An Opportunity In 1943 To Photograph Japanese-American Internees At The Manzanar War Relocation Center, Then Run By His Friend And Fellow Sierra Club Member, Ralph Merritt.</P> <P>Adams Had Already Completed A Number Of Assignments For The Military As A Civilian, Including Teaching Photography At Fort Ord And Photographing Yosemite'S Ahwahnee Hotel, Which Was Used As A Navy Hospital During The War. But He Was Anxious For A More Meaningful Project Related To The War Effort. Adams'S Documentation Of Manzanar Would Become His Most Significant War-Related Project.</P> <Figure Class=""Image-Align-Right""><A Href=""/Resource/Ppprs.00369/""><Img Src=""/Collections/Static/Ansel-Adams-Manzanar/Images/Baseball.Jpg"" Alt=""""  /></A>  <Figcaption><A Href=""/Item/2002695992"">Baseball Game, Manzanar Relocation Center</A></Figcaption> </Figure> <P>During The Fall Of 1943, Adams Photographed At The Manzanar War Relocation Center, Which Was Located In Inyo County, California, At The Eastern Edge Of The Sierra Nevada Mountains Approximately 200 Miles Northeast Of Los Angeles. This Series Was A Departure From His Usual Landscape Photography. Adams Produced An Essay On The Japanese-Americans Interned In This Beautiful, But Remote And Undeveloped Region Where The Mountains Served As Both A Metaphorical Fortress And An Inspiration For The Internees. Concentrating On The Internees And Their Activities, Adams Photographed Family Life In The Barracks; People At Work– Internees As Welders, Farmers, And Garment Makers; And Recreational Activities, Including Baseball And Volleyball Games.</P> In 1944 A Selection Of These Images Along With Text By Adams Was Published By U. S. Camera In A 112-Page Book, Born Free And Equal. In A Letter To His Friend Nancy Newhall, The Wife Of Beaumont Newhall, Curator Of Photography At The Museum Of Modern Art, Adams Wrote: ""Through The Pictures The Reader Will Be Introduced To Perhaps Twenty Individuals . . . Loyal American Citizens Who Are Anxious To Get Back Into The Stream Of Life And Contribute To Our Victory."" The Book Received Positive Reviews And Made The San Francisco Chronicle'S Bestseller List For March And April Of 1945. </P> <P>In Addition To His Work At The Camp, Adams Photographed The Mountains Near Manzanar. Two Of His Most Famous Landscape Photographs Were Made During His Visit To Manzanar, Mount Williamson, The Sierra Nevada, From Manzanar, California, 1944 And Winter Sunrise, The Sierra Nevada, From Lone Pine, California, 1944. These Dramatic Photographs Were Not Included As Part Of The Adams Gift To The Library. </P> <Figure Class=""Image-Align-Left"" Style=""Width: 160Px;""><A Href=""/Resource/Ppprs.00249/""><Img Src=""/Collections/Static/Ansel-Adams-Manzanar/Images/Toyo.Gif"" Alt="""" /></A>  <Figcaption><A Href=""/Item/2002695956/"">Toyo Miyatake Family, Manzanar Relocation Center</A></Figcaption> </Figure> <P>Adams Was Not The Only Photographer To Work At Manzanar. One Of The Internees, Toyo Miyatake, Had Worked As A Los Angeles Portrait Photographer Before He Was Moved To Manzanar. Although The Internees Were Not Allowed To Have Cameras, Miyatake Fashioned One From Parts He Brought With Him In His Luggage. Both Adams'S And Miyatake'S Photographs Present A Positive View Of The Japanese Americans Interned At Manzanar. In Contrast, Dorothea Lange, Who Had Earned Her Reputation As A Social Documentary Photographer With Images Of Migrant Farm Workers Made During The Depression, Worked For The War Relocation Authority Photographing The Evacuation Of Japanese-Americans And Their Arrival At Manzanar. Lange'S Vision Is Uniquely Unlike Adams And Miyatake. She Photographed The Upheaval Of The Evacuation And The Bleak Conditions Of The Internment Camps.</P> <H3>""A Grave Injustice""...A Congressional Apology </H3> <P>In 1988, Apologizing On Behalf Of The Nation For The ""Grave Injustice"" Done To Persons Of Japanese Ancestry, Congress Implemented The Civil Liberties Act. Congress Declared That The Internments Were ""Motivated Largely By Racial Prejudice, Wartime Hysteria, And A Failure Of Political Leadership,"" And Authorized A $20,000 Payment To Japanese-Americans Who Suffered Injustices During World War Ii. </P>",,California,Manzanar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No Known Copyright Restrictions

By That Date, However, Rickey Had Already Built An Impressive Career As A Player, Manager, And Baseball Executive, Which Eventually Earned Him A Place In The National Baseball Hall Of Fame In Cooperstown, New York. The Scouting Reports, Which Are Located In A Series Of Baseball Files In The Rickey Collection, Were Compiled Between 1951 And 1964. They Are Mostly Concentrated In The Years 1951-1956 And 1962-1963, While Rickey Was Associated, Respectively, With The Pittsburgh Pirates And St. Louis Cardinals.</P>  <P>The Reports Document Rickey'S Skill In Analyzing Various Aspects Of A Player'S Game. They Reveal His Candor In Assessing A Player'S Talent And Sometimes Include Blunt Comments About A Player'S Upbringing Or Family Background. Some Of The Better-Known Names Featured Include Hank Aaron, Lou Brock, Steve Carlton, Roberto Clemente, Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson, Harmon Killebrew, Sandy Koufax, Willie Mays, Bill Mazeroski, Stan Musial, And Frank Robinson. Future Managers George Lee ""Sparky"" Anderson And Albert Fred ""Red"" Schoendienst Are Also Evaluated As Players.

The More Than 5,100 Photographic Prints And 355 Glass Negatives In The Prints And Photographs Division'S Holdings, Together With The Often Extensive Captions That Describe The Photo Subjects, Reflect The Results Of This Early Documentary Effort, Offering A Detailed Depiction Of Working And Living Conditions Of Many Children--And Adults--In The United States Between 1908 And 1924.</P>  <P>Hine Later Referred To His Photographic Work For The Nclc As ""Detective Work."" Photo Historian Daile Kaplan Offers This Picture Of How Hine Conducted His Work, Which Was Frequently Regarded With Suspicion By Business Owners, Supervisors, And Workers:</P>  <P>Nattily Dressed In A Suit, Tie, And Hat, Hine The Gentleman Actor And Mimic Assumed A Variety Of Personas--Including Bible Salesman, Postcard Salesman, And Industrial Photographer Making A Record Of Factory Machinery--To Gain Entrance To The Workplace. When Unable To Deflect His Confrontations With Management, He Simply Waited Outside The Canneries, Mines, Factories, Farms, And Sweatshops With His Fifty Pounds Of Photographic Equipment And Photographed Children As They Entered And Exited The Workplace.

Hine Was Influential In This Effort, Particularly After He Was Promoted To The Head Of The Nclc Exhibits Department In 1913.</Li>  </Ul>  <P>Mrs. Gertrude Folks Zimand, Acting For The Nclc In Her Capacity As Chief Executive, Gave The Records Of The Nclc To The Library Of Congress Manuscript Division In 1954, In Celebration Of The Nclc'S Fiftieth Anniversary. The Manuscript Division Then Transferred To The Prints And Photographs Division The Photographs (Arranged In 21 Albums), Negatives, And Caption Cards. (The Nclc Apparently Also Offered The Library Of Congress A File Of Nitrate Negatives, Which The Library Did Not Accept. Some Original Negatives Can Be Found At The University Of Maryland, Baltimore County And The International Museum Of Photography And Film At George Eastman House.

A Few Captions Cite Other Photographers Or Photo Studios. Many Captions Lack Any Photographer Attribution.</P>  <P>The Photographic Prints Found In The Nclc Records Are On Single Weight Paper. Most Range In Size From 3.5 X 3.5 Inches To 5 X 7 Inches And Are Probably Contact Prints From 4 X 6 Inch And 5 X 7 Inch Negatives; Both Of Those Sizes Are Represented In The Glass Negatives In The Collection. Hine Apparently Did Not Enjoy Darkroom Work And Employed Assistants To Print His Photographs Whenever Possible. Some Of The Prints Show The Effects Of Inadequate Photographic Processing And, Quite Possibly, Wear And Tear From Their Original Use And Housing.</P>  <P>Hine, Or Someone At The Nclc, Numbered The Photographs 1 - 5126, With Some Letter Suffixes (E.G., 1A) To Make The Numbers Unique. By Convention, The Prints And Photographs Division Has Come To Refer To These As ""Hine Numbers.""</P>  <P>The Nclc Delivered The Collection To The Library Of Congress In Albums Organized By Type Of Industry And, Within That, By Hine Number. In 1968, Library Staff Remounted The Photographs In New Albums And Subsequently Microfilmed The Collection, To Reduce Its Handling.

It Appears That The Nclc Had A System For Reproducing The Captions On Strips Of Paper, Because Many Of The Caption Cards Consist Of A Label Strip Affixed To The Card With Added Annotations Above And Below. Some Strips Were Cut In Such A Way As To Cut Off Information Or Attributions. Over The Years, Library Of Congress Staff Have Added Annotations To Indicate The Availability Of Corresponding Negatives (An Lc-H5 Or Lc-H51 Stamp On A Card Signalled The Availability Of A Corresponding Glass Negative That Came With The Collection) And, Occasionally, To Correct Or Amplify Identification Information Given On The Cards.</P>  <P>We Do Not Know Precisely Who Compiled The Caption Cards Or How, Although It Seems Logical To Assume That Hine Recorded The Information They Contain. Information On Many Cards Echoes Statements Hine Made In His Reports. Daile Kaplan, In Editing Hine'S Letters, Attributes The Captions To Hine And Notes That He Later Referred To The Process Of ""Synchronizing"" The Information With The Photographs (Kaplan, P. Xx). Having Trained In Stenography, Hine Was No Doubt In A Good Position To Make Rapid And Detailed Notes About The Scenes And People He Photographed.</P>  <P>In A Few Cases, It Is Apparent That The Caption Writer Was Working Considerably After The Taking Of The Photograph, Because The Caption Refers To Later Revisiting Of The Same Subject Or Indicates That Information Should Be Filled In At A Later Point If The Correct Identification Can Be Found. Many Captions Cite The Name Of A Witness (Including Other Nclc Staff Members Or, Sometimes, Hine'S Wife, Sara), As Well As The Name Of The Photographer. Some Captions Make Reference To Associated Reports, Many Of Which Can Be Found In The Library Of Congress Manuscript Division (See ""<A Href=""/Collections/National-Child-Labor-Committee/Articles-And-Essays/Reporting-On-Labor-Conditions/"">Reporting On Labor Conditions</A>"").</P>  <P>Although The Accuracy Of The Information In The Captions Cannot Easily Be Verified, The Captions Often Supply Highly Detailed And Evocative Information About The Conditions Being Photographed And The Photography Enterprise Itself.</P>  <Ul>   <Li>Many Captions Cite Names, Ages, Addresses, Work Tasks, Hours, And Wages Of Individuals Photographed.

When He Stepped Onto Ebbets Field On April 15Th, 1947, Robinson Became The First African American In The Twentieth Century To Play Baseball In The Major Leagues -- Breaking The ""Color Line,"" A Segregation Practice Dating To The Nineteenth Century. Jackie Robinson Was An Extremely Talented Multi-Sport Athlete And A Courageous Man Who Played An Active Role In Civil Rights. This Presentation Was Created To Commemorate His Achievements And Describe Some Aspects Of The Color Line'S Development And The Negro Leagues. Materials That Tell His Story, And The History Of Baseball In General, Are Located Throughout The Library Of Congress. This Web Presentation Was Made Possible By A Generous Gift From The Citigroup Foundation.</P> <H2>Selection Criteria</H2> While The Library Of Congress Does Not Have Collections That Focus Solely On Jackie Robinson, The Baseball Color Line, Or The Negro Leagues, Diverse Original Materials Relevant To All Of These Topics Can Be Found Through The Library'S Numerous Reading Rooms. With The Goal Of Representing Many Different Media, Library Staff Selected And Reproduced Approximately 30 Interesting Items Created Between The 1860S And The 1960S, Including Manuscripts, Photographs, Ephemera, And Books. Narrative Information Drawn From Encyclopedia Articles, Published Biographies, And Baseball Histories Established The Context For Understanding The Original Materials.</P> The Library Holds Additional Original Materials That Could Not Be Reproduced Here, Either Because They Are Still Under Copyright Protection (For Example, Nbc Radio Broadcasts), Or, Because Digitization Would Be Very Expensive (For Example, The Full-Length Movie The Jackie Robinson Story).</P> This Online Presentation Introduces A Multi-Faceted Man And A Variety Of Complex Issues, Topics, And Events That Risk Oversimplification In Any Short Retelling. Books Listed In The <A Href=""/Collections/Jackie-Robinson-Baseball/About-This-Collection/Related-Resources/#Bibliography"">Bibliography</A> Should Be Consulted For Further Information.</P> The Breadth Of Resources At The Library Of Congress Is Impressive, But Other Libraries And Organizations Also Offer A Wealth Of Information On These Subjects.

Researchers Arrange With The Library'S Photoduplication Service To Produce Copies Of Selected Items. Typically Ordered Are 8X10-Inch Prints Or 4X5-Inch Color Transparencies. In Order To Make The Prints, The Photoduplication Service Must Create A Copy Negative, If None Exists. Afterwards, Those Negatives And Color Transparencies Are Added To A File Of High-Demand Images Maintained By The Prints And Photographs Division.</P> In 1996, This File Contained Approximately 120,000 Negatives And Transparencies. The High Demand Image File Serves As A Ready Reference Source For Many Of The Library'S Most Popular Pictures. The High-Demand Image File Complements The Division'S Heavily Used Collections Of Original Negatives, Including Its Selected Civil War Photographs , Farm Security Administration/Office Of War Information Collection (Forthcoming), And Historic American Buildings Survey And Historic American Engineering Record Collections.</P> Over Time, The Library Plans To Place A Significant Percentage Of The High-Demand File Online Under The Series Title ""By Popular Demand."" The First Group Of Images Will Consist Of Items Which Appear In Staff-Selected Illustrated Reference Aids.

The Collection Reproduces 35 Of The Guides, Which Were Published By The  Spalding Athletic Company In The Late Nineteenth And Early Twentieth  Centuries.  Spalding’S Official Base Ball Guide Was Perhaps The  Premier Publication Of Its Day For The Game Of Baseball. It Featured  Editorials From Baseball Writers On The State Of The Game, Statistics,  Photographs, And Analysis Of The Previous Season For All The Major  League Teams And For Many Of The So-Called Minor Leagues Across The  Nation. The 15  Spalding’S Official Base Ball Guides Included In This Online Collection Were Published Between 1889 And 1939. The  Official Indoor Baseball Guide Concerns A Game Unfamiliar To Most Contemporary Baseball Fans Because  Its Demise Occurred Almost Beyond Living Memory. These Guides, Too,  Offer Rules And “How-To’S” Of The Game, Information On The Game’S  Founding Fathers, Photographic Illustrations Of Teams And Players From  Across The Land, And Game Statistics. The 20  Official Indoor Base Ball Guides Included In This Collection Were Published Between 1903 And 1926 During His More Than Twenty-One Years' Involvement With Baseball’S  Major Leagues, A.G. (Albert Goodwill) Spalding (1850-1915) Was A  Baseball Player, Manager, And Executive. With His Brother He Began The  Sporting-Goods Manufacturing And Retail Business That Still Bears His  Name And Is Known To Millions. He Also Founded A Publishing House, The  American Sports Publishing Company Between The Late Nineteenth And The Mid-Twentieth Centuries, The  American Sports Publishing Company Issued Works That Can Be Classified  In Three General Categories. The First Is Instructional Manuals, Such As  How To Play Second Base, How To Bowl, And How To Play American Hand Ball.  The Second Is Rule Books For Many Sports. The Third Category, And The  One Most Widely Used By Researchers And Sports Historians, Is The  Annuals That Both Narratively And Statistically Summarized The Previous  Year'S History, Accomplishments, And Records For A Specific Sport. A Few  Of The Sports Covered Are Baseball, Women'S Basketball, Golf, College  Football, And Track And Field Athletics. Collectively, These Are Known  As Spalding Guides. In Addition To The Text, All Guides Included An  Advertising Section For The Spalding Sporting-Goods Empire That Provides  A Fascinating History Of The Development Of Everything From Baseball  Gloves, Tennis Racquets, And Ice Skates To Golf Clubs And Football  Cleats; The Spalding Company Made Them All The Library Of Congress Has More Than One Thousand Of These Guides,  Believed To Be The Largest Collection Held By Any Institution. A Small  Sample Is Offered Here In  Spalding Base Ball Guides, 1889-1939; In The Future, The Entire Collection May Be Digitized And Made Available On This Web Site. The Twenty  Official Indoor Base Ball Guides And Fifteen  Spalding'S Official Base Ball Guides Currently Presented Are Examples Of The Annuals Described Above While The Game Of Baseball Covered In  Spalding’S Official Base Ball Guides Is Well Known To Most Americans, The Game Described In The  Official Indoor Base Ball Guides May At First Seem Unfamiliar--Yet In Its Current Incarnation It Is  Probably Played By More Americans Than Traditional Baseball. According  To  The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary, Indoor Baseball Is  “ He Original Name For The Game From Which Modern Softball Derived.  Its Rules Were Written By George W. Hancock Of Chicago Who Was One Of  The Group Of Young Men Who Created The Game, Using A Boxing Glove For A  Ball And A Broomstick For A Bat, While Waiting At The Farragut Boat Club  For The Telegraphed Results Of The Harvard-Yale Football Game On  Thanksgiving Day, 1887. Thus, Softball In Its First Incarnation Was  Baseball Played Inside A Gymnasium” (Paul Dickson,  The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary [New York: Harcourt, Brace And Company, 1990], P. 268) Brief Biographies Of A.G. Spalding Can Be Found In  The Ballplayers, Edited By Mike Shatzkin (New York: Arbor House/William Morrow, 1990; Library Of Congress Call Number Gv865.A1 B323 1990) And  Biographical Dictionary Of American Sports.
